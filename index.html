        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>Writing has always been my way of understanding the world. Jon & Ari's journey is personal, challenging the stereotypes that often define queer stories. Instead of suffering, shame, or tragic endings, this is a tale of growth, deep emotional connection, and love that stands on equal ground.</p>

        <h2>What Makes This Book Different?</h2>
        <p>Too many stories about gay love focus on trauma, struggle, or societal rejection. Jon & Ari is a story of love between two men who never needed permission to exist. It’s about partnership, mutual respect, and an exploration of identity that doesn't rely on outdated tropes.</p>
